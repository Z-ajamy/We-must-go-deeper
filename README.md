- Basics of printing output in C++ using `cout`.
- Example programs illustrating different output methods.

#### 2-NAMESPACE

- Understanding and using namespaces in C++.

#### 10-Relational\_Operators

- Covers relational operators such as `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` with practical examples.

#### 11-Logical\_operators

- Explains logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) with extensive examples.

#### 12-Math\_Functions\_in\_CPP

- Demonstrates the use of built-in mathematical functions such as `pow()`, `sqrt()`, `abs()`, etc.

#### 13-Structures

- Covers defining and using `struct` in C++.

#### 14-Enums

- Demonstrates how to use enumerations in C++.

#### 15-Nested\_Structures\_and\_Enums

- Explores advanced use of structures and enumerations.

#### 16-Data\_Type\_Conversion

- Focuses on implicit and explicit type conversions in C++.

#### 17-Strings

- Covers basic and advanced string manipulations.

#### 18-Functions

- Introduction to functions in C++, including return values and function prototypes.

#### 19-more\_Functions

- Explores additional function concepts like function overloading.

#### 20-even\_more\_Functions

- Covers more advanced function topics, including recursion.

#### 21-Global\_Variables

- Discusses the use and implications of global variables in C++.

#### 22-By-Val\_vs\_By-Ref

- Explores passing arguments by value vs. passing by reference.

#### 23-Structures\_and\_Functions-Reusability

- Demonstrates the combination of structures and functions for reusable code.

#### 24-Arrays

- Covers working with arrays, including initialization and iteration.

#### 25-Arrays\_Function

- Explains functions that work with arrays.

#### 26-Arrays-Structure-Function

- Explores integrating arrays with structures and functions.

#### 27-if\_else

- Covers conditional statements using `if-else` in C++.

#### 28-Switch

- Demonstrates switch-case statements with examples.

#### 29-Nested\_Functions\_with\_Enums

- Covers nesting functions and using enums inside functions.
